## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

## Configuration

Active links are generated through javascript. The items are stacked vertically and are placed on the left side of the page.

## Known Issues

The left navigation bar takes precidence of the entire view, later versions should address this problem.
